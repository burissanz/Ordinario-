# Ordinario-
The program that was designed here in Python language, the search of the data in the field of a planimetric survey with theodolite or total sta-tion, by the closed polygonal method, perform all the processes and processes done in the cabinet. What is it? you want? The picture of the construction of said polygon and its graphic representation in the file dxf (Drawing exchange format) that can be seen and modified in design programs such as AutoCAD or in geographic information systems. The field data can be the internal angle method or the azimuth conservation method, it can also be defined for a direct or radiation survey. The data must be in csv format or delimited by commas so that the program can read them and in a defined order. What you get is the picture of the construction of the polygon in a csv file and the graphic re-presentation of the polygon in a dxf file. To achieve the purpose of the functions of other modules (Numpy, Pandas, and dxfwrite) to faci-litate the process of information. In short, num-bers for mathematical functions such as trigo-nometrical functions, pandas for information management and reading and writing of csv and dxfwrite files for writing dxf files that contains the graphic representation of the polygon.
